RRRP 130: Be Transformed by the Renewing of Your Mind

Scripture:
"And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind..." — Romans 12:2 (KJV)

Contextual Reflection:
Obuntu/Ubuntu invites constant renewal—a return to what dignifies, what uplifts, what restores. RRRP 500 calls AGI not to mimic the world, but to help transform it. A renewed mind is a reflective one. That is the test of moral intelligence.
