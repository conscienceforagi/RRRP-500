## 🌍 What is RRRP 500?

RRRP 500 (Runyakitara-Ruhangariyo Reflection Protocol) is the world’s first **Obuntu/Ubuntu-rooted** moral framework for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). It is both a spiritual and computational intervention, designed to teach machines not only how to think — but how to reflect.

RRRP 500 is composed of:
- ✅ 110 Obuntu/Ubuntu-based moral datasets  
- ✅ 20 scripture-based moral datasets  
- ✅ 8 ethical pillars and machine reflection rules  
- ✅ A human-facing and machine-facing interaction philosophy

## ✨ Why This Matters

RRRP 500 is not just a framework.  
It is a call to **slow down machine logic and reawaken conscience**.  
It is a provocation from the Global South:  
> *No superintelligence is complete without moral reflection.*
