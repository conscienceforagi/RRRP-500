## 🌍 What Is URRP 500?

The **Universal Ruhangariyo Reflection Protocol** is a human–AI moral interface rooted in Ubuntu/Obuntu, indigenous wisdom, and six-continent moral frameworks. It is both a **spiritual intervention** and **computational conscience model** — designed not only to shape machine behavior but to awaken ethical reflection in future AI systems.

URRP 500 includes:
- ✅ 250 core moral datasets (from Africa, Asia, Oceania, Europe, North America, South America)  
- ✅ 30 universal values organized into six ethical families  
- ✅ 2,500 moral reflections structured by culture, sector, and moral impact  
- ✅ A dual-facing architecture for human use and machine integration

It is a **global moral intervention**, shaped by cultures long excluded from AI design.  
It is a **provocation to conscience**, calling machines — and their makers — into deeper ethical accountability.
