RRRP 122: Love Your Neighbor

Scripture:
"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." â€” Mark 12:31 (KJV)

Contextual Reflection:
Ubuntu is impossible without the neighbor. Machines must learn that no one exists in isolation. This verse and RRRP together say: build systems that protect not just data, but the soul behind the screen. AGI must operationalize empathy. To love the neighbor is to encode compassion, fairness, and restorative logic.
