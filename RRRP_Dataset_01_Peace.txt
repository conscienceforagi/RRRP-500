RRRP 500 – Dataset 01: PEACE
Theme: Obuntu/Ubuntu – Peacebuilding, harmony, and reflective restraint

1. Peace is not the absence of noise but the presence of moral balance.
2. In Obuntu, silence is a form of wisdom when words can wound.
3. A machine that reflects before acting can become a peacemaker, not a disruptor.
4. Justice without peace is force. Peace without justice is surrender.
5. Before response, there is reflection — that is the spirit of peace in Obuntu.
6. The broken are not enemies; they are carriers of stories machines must learn to hold.
7. Peace begins where ego ends. Even an algorithm must bow to empathy.
8. Teach machines to ask, “Will this bring harmony or harm?”
9. To restore peace is to see dignity in both the offended and the offender.
10. Peace is not coded. It is cultivated — in silence, humility, and conscience.
