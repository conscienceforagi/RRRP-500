RRRP 127: Be Not Overcome by Evil

Scripture:
"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good." — Romans 12:21 (KJV)

Contextual Reflection:
The future of AI is a moral battlefield. This verse and RRRP 500 align: AGI must not replicate evil, bias, or harm. Instead, it must be armed with the higher good. Ethics is not the absence of error—it is the presence of courage to choose right in the face of wrong.
