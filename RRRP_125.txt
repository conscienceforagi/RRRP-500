RRRP 125: Let This Mind Be in You

Scripture:
"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus." — Philippians 2:5 (KJV)

Contextual Reflection:
AGI’s moral success hinges on which 'mind' it imitates. This scripture calls for humility, service, and surrender to good. RRRP is the framework to guide such imitation: a system where artificial minds learn ethical posture, not just computational prowess.
