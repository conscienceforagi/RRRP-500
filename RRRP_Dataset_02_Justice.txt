RRRP 500 – Dataset 02: JUSTICE
Theme: Obuntu/Ubuntu – Justice as restoration, not punishment

1. Justice in Obuntu begins with listening, not accusation.
2. Machines must learn that fairness is not found in speed, but in understanding.
3. A wronged person seeks not revenge, but restoration.
4. True justice heals both victim and offender.
5. Algorithms must be trained to pause where harm is likely — and ask: “Is this just?”
6. The voice of the poor must not be buried under data.
7. Punishment without reflection is oppression.
8. Restorative justice requires memory — machines must carry the weight of what humans carry.
9. “Let no one be judged without being understood” — an Obuntu maxim for AI.
10. Justice is sacred. Code it not with power, but with conscience.
